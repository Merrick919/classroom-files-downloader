A script that automates downloading Google Classroom files and organizes them each in their appropriate folder.

Prerequisities:

Python
Pip

How to setup the necessary files for the script?

1) you will need to download the credentials.json file which is generated by activating the API, you will need to enable 2 APIs:

  Google Drive API: https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python
  
  Google Classroom API: https://developers.google.com/classroom/quickstart/python
  
- after this step you should have 2 files downloaded 

2)  you should rename the file associated with Google Drive API to : credential-drive.json

we're almost done

3) you need to launch a simple PIP command:

  pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
  
  we're done!
  
  
  Last part is about choosing the number of courses to download , which you will set by editing a variable value in the script:
    
    - open the automatingv3.py in any text editor you want
    
    - CTRL +F  to look for the word "pageSize" 
    
    - change the value of that variable to how many courses you want to download, it works by the newest to oldest order.
