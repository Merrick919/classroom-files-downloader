### Description

A script that automates downloading Google Classroom files and organizes them each in their appropriate folder.

    - Google Drive API: https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python

2. Rename the 2 files:

    - Rename the file associated with the Google Classroom API to "credentials-classroom.json"
    - Rename the file associated with the Google Drive API to "credentials-drive.json"

3. Run the command:

    `pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib`
  
4. Choose the number of courses to download, you can set this by editing a variable value in the script:
    
    - Open the automating.py file in any text editor
    - Search for (CTRL + F) the word "pageSize"
    - Change the value of that variable to how many courses you want to download, it works by the newest to oldest order.

    `python automating.py`
